# INFO216: Group Project - Spring 2021
## <i>Creating a Knowledge Graph for Bill Propositions to the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget)</i>

This repository contains code and other resources for a group project in the UiB course [INFO216](https://www.uib.no/emne/INFO216): Knowledge Graphs. 
The project group consists of three UiB students: [Fredrik Bjerk Marveng](https://github.com/FredrikMarveng), [Per-Anders Bjune](https://github.com/Per-Anders) and [Sebastian Einar RÃ¸kholt](https://github.com/SebastianRokholt).

The aim of this project is to create a knowledge graph based on lawmaker propositions to the Norwegian Parlament (Stortinget), with 
the end goal of connecting the graph to UiB's existing [NewsAngler](https://www.uib.no/infomedia/114138/news-angler-discovering-unexpected-connections-news) research project. 
The data will be lifted semantically from the website [Stortinget.no](https://www.stortinget.no/no/Saker-og-publikasjoner/Saker).
