# Stortinget.no-Knowledge-Graph
A group project for the UiB course INFO216: Knowledge Graphs. 

The aim of this project is to create a knowledge graph based on lawmaker propositions to the Norwegian Parlament (Stortinget), with 
the end goal of connecting the graph to UiB's existing NewsAngler research project. 
The data will be lifted semantically from the website Stortinget.no.
